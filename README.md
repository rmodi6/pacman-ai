This repository contains solutions to the Pacman AI Search, Multiagent and Ghostbusters problems from UC Berkeley's CS188 Intro to AI Pacman projects [page](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).

## pacman-ai-search
The search problem includes implementation of uninformed search algorithms like depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), uniform cost search, and A star search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

## pacman-ai-multiagent
The multiagent problem requires modeling an adversarial and a stochastic search agent using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

## pacman-ai-ghostbusters
The ghostbusters problem involves designing a Pacman agent that uses sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. It includes implementation of exact inference in a bayesian network using the forward algorithm.
